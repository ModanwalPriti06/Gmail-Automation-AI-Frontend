# Solution for handling project

## PART 1: Intelligent Follow-up System (Backend Only)

### Overview of What We‚Äôll Build in Part 1
- We are building an automated email follow-up system that:
- Connects to Gmail API
- Reads sent emails
- Detects if the recipient was supposed to respond
- Schedules a follow-up only if we are waiting on them
- Generates context-aware follow-up emails
- Follows up within business hours (10AM‚Äì7PM)
- Uses a free LLM (AI) to analyze context (like Together.ai)

### Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (for storing follow-up schedules, logs)
- Gmail API (to send/read emails)
- Together.ai or other LLM (for email context analysis)
- Node-cron (to schedule follow-ups)

## ‚úÖ TODAY‚ÄôS TASK: Project Setup & Gmail API Connection
1. Setup Node.js Project
2. Setup .env File
3. Basic Express Server
4. Connect Gmail API (OAuth2 Setup)
     - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com
     - Click ‚ÄúCreate Project‚Äù, Name: Gmail Workflow MCP
     - After creating, select the project from the dropdown.
5. Enable Gmail API
  - In the left sidebar, go to APIs & Services > Library
  - Search for Gmail API
  - Click it ‚Üí Click Enable
6. Set Up OAuth 2.0 Credentials
7. Generate Refresh Token - Visit: https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground
8. Sending and Reading Emails Using Gmail API in Node.js
9. Send Email via Gmail API
10. Create ALl Route
11. Add Route to index.js
    
## Testing

1. Email sent successfully
```
POST http://localhost:5000/api/email/send

{
  "to": "recipient@example.com",
  "subject": "Test Follow-up",
  "message": "Hello, this is a test email from Gmail MCP automation system."
}
```

12. Read Sent Emails (to Detect Follow-Up Dependencies)
    
## Test Sent Email Reading
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/email/sent

//You should see something like:
{
  "emails": [
    {
      "to": "abc@example.com",
      "subject": "Follow-up",
      "date": "Wed, 3 Jul 2025 10:25:00 +0530",
      "snippet": "Hey, just following up on our last..."
    },
    ...
  ]
}

```

13. Follow-up Detection & Smart Scheduling
14. Set Up MongoDB Model
15. Update Sent Email Controller to Track Follow-Ups
16. Schedule Follow-Ups
17. Implement Cron

## Test:
1. Send an email
2. It stores in FollowUp collection
3. Wait 24 hours (or change to 1 hour for testing)
4. Cron job sends a follow-up and updates DB

18. Detect Replies from Recipients (Mark Follow-up as Done)
19. Add Reply Detection Logic - checkReplies.js

## Test End-to-End
1. Send an email using your API.
2. It stores in MongoDB.
3. Simulate a reply to that email (manually reply from another Gmail).
4. Wait 1 minute for cron to run.
5. MongoDB follow-up entry should become:
```
"status": "replied"
```
6. No further follow-ups will be sent for that thread.

20. BONUS: Want to view all follow-ups? /followups
```
‚úî Sending email
‚úî Saving sent thread
‚úî Scheduling follow-ups with increasing urgency
‚úî Detecting replies
‚úî Marking follow-up complete
```

21. Intelligent Meeting Scheduling via Google Calendar API
  - Enable Google Calendar API
  - Utility Function for Calendar Availability
  - Endpoint to Auto-Schedule Meeting

## Test - API Request (POST)
```
POST /schedule-meeting
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "to": "prospect@example.com",
  "subject": "Follow-up discussion",
  "body": "Hi, can we schedule a call to discuss the proposal?"
}
```
### Expected Result:
- ‚úÖ Detects intent
- ‚úÖ Checks calendar
- ‚úÖ Finds first available 1-hour slot between 10am-7pm
- ‚úÖ Schedules meeting via Google Calendar
- ‚úÖ Sends back meeting link & details

22. Use LLM to Detect Intent + Generate Agenda
23. Update /schedule-meeting API to Use LLM
```
// BONUS: Suggest Alternative Time Slots

if (slots.length === 0) {
  const nextDaySlots = await getFreeSlots(new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000));
  return res.status(400).json({
    message: "No free slots today. Suggesting alternatives.",
    suggestions: nextDaySlots.slice(0, 3),
  });
}

```
24. Context-Aware Response
